All Employees, who have same names and salaries are equal, so they should have same hashcode. Also hashCode method of Employee
object depends on name, salary and visited values. But when Employee object appears second time in HashMap the 
tracker.get(e).setVisited(true) line of code changes the visited value. So next time it will show different hashcode for 
employee object which is already in HashMap. It means that the index of hashtable will be different, so tracker.containsKey(e)
returns false and it put the employee again in HashMap.
